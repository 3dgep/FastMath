# FastMath

The _FastMath_ repository is intended to be used as a learning tool for beginning C++ game programmers. The primary object is to teach the reader how to create a template math library in C++. Several topics are covered in these technical articles including:

1. Vector math
2. Matrix math
3. Quaternion math
4. C++ Templates

Vectors and matrices are arguably the most common mathematical primitives used in games, especially in graphics programming.

FastMath is a C++ template math library for use in games.
